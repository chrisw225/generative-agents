# Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior

## Project Overview
This repository implements the research paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" by Park et al. (2023). It creates AI agents that simulate believable human behaviors in a virtual environment called Smallville.

## Core Purpose
- **Research Platform**: Demonstrates how large language models can create agents that exhibit human-like behaviors
- **Behavioral Simulation**: Agents perform daily activities, form relationships, and make decisions based on their experiences
- **Memory-Driven Actions**: Agents use sophisticated memory systems to drive contextually appropriate behaviors

## Key Features
- **25+ Simultaneous Agents**: Each with unique personalities, memories, and behaviors
- **Persistent Memory**: Long-term storage of experiences, conversations, and learned patterns
- **Dynamic Planning**: Agents create and modify daily plans based on their goals and circumstances
- **Social Interactions**: Agents can converse, form relationships, and influence each other's behaviors
- **Visual Environment**: Web-based frontend showing agent movements and interactions in real-time

## Research Applications
- Human-AI interaction studies
- Social simulation research
- Behavioral modeling
- Multi-agent systems development

## Repository Structure
- `reverie/`: Core simulation engine
- `environment/`: Django-based web frontend
- `storage/`: Simulation data and saved states
