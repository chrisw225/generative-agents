    B --> G
    B --> H
    A --> C
    A --> D
```

**Benefits**:

## Memory System Architecture

### AI Town: Simple Vector Memory
```typescript
interface AgentMemory {
  // Simple vector-based memory
  embeddings: number[][];
  importance: number[];
  recency: number[];
  
  // Built-in similarity search
  retrieve(query: string): Memory[];
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- Lightweight and fast
- Built-in vector search
- Automatic relevance scoring
- Limited complexity

### Generative Agents: Three-Tier Memory System
```python
class Persona:
    # Complex memory architecture
    a_mem: AssociativeMemory    # Long-term event storage
    s_mem: SpatialMemory       # Location awareness
    scratch: Scratch           # Current state
    
    # Rich memory nodes
    class ConceptNode:
        description: str
        embedding: List[float]
        keywords: Set[str]
        poignancy: int         # Importance score
        created: datetime
        last_accessed: datetime
```

**Characteristics**:
- Rich memory structures
- Multiple memory types
- Detailed metadata
- Research-grade complexity

## Communication Patterns

### AI Town: Real-time Reactive
```typescript
// Frontend automatically updates when backend changes
const world = useQuery(api.game.main.worldStatus, { worldId });

// Immediate mutations with optimistic updates
const sendInput = useMutation(api.game.main.sendInput);
await sendInput({ 
  name: 'moveTo', 
  args: { destination: { x, y } } 
});

// Streaming LLM responses
const conversation = useQuery(api.messages.list, { conversationId });
```

### Generative Agents: File-based Polling
```python
# Backend writes state files
curr_env_file = f"{sim_folder}/environment/{self.step}.json"
with open(curr_env_file, "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(json.dumps(environment_state, indent=2))

# Frontend polls for file changes
def check_for_updates():
    if check_if_file_exists(curr_env_file):
        with open(curr_env_file) as json_file:
            new_env = json.load(json_file)
        return new_env
```

## Game Loop Architecture

### AI Town: Tick-based with Batching
```typescript
class AbstractGame {
  // High-frequency simulation (60 FPS)
  tick(now: number): void {
    this.processInputs();
    this.updateAgents();
    this.updatePhysics();
  }
  
  // Low-frequency persistence (1 Hz)
  saveStep(): GameStateDiff {
    return this.generateStateDiff();
  }
}
```

**Flow**:
1. 60 FPS ticks for smooth gameplay
2. 1 Hz database saves for efficiency
3. Historical interpolation for movement
4. Async LLM operations don't block

### Generative Agents: Step-based Simulation
```python
class ReverieServer:
    def start_server(self, int_counter):
        while int_counter > 0:
            # Wait for frontend environment file
            if check_if_file_exists(curr_env_file):
                # Process all agents synchronously
                for persona in self.personas.values():
                    next_tile, desc = persona.move(...)
                
                # Save movement file for frontend
                with open(curr_move_file, "w") as outfile:
                    outfile.write(json.dumps(movements))
                
                int_counter -= 1
```

**Flow**:
1. Step-by-step simulation
2. Synchronous agent processing
3. File-based frontend communication
4. Manual step control

## Key Takeaways

### Fundamental Differences
1. **Purpose**: Game platform vs Research simulation
2. **Architecture**: Cloud-native vs Local file-based

├── Scaling requirements (Many users vs Deep agents)
├── Development resources (Modern vs Custom)
├── Deployment needs (Cloud vs Local)
└── Complexity requirements (Simple vs Rich)
```

### Future Considerations
- **Convergence**: Both approaches may evolve toward each other
- **Hybrid Solutions**: Combining real-time with deep psychology
- **Standardization**: Common interfaces for agent behaviors
- **Tooling**: Better development tools for both approaches

This comparison shows that while both projects simulate AI agents, they represent completely different architectural philosophies optimized for different goals. Understanding these differences is crucial for choosing the right approach for your specific use case.
